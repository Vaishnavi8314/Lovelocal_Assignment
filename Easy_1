Question : Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

Logic : 
The given string input is splitted using split() function which creates a list of words, then using indexing and len() built-in function the length of the last word of the string is calaculated and printed as an output.

Algorithm :
1. Give the input string.
2. Split the string using split() function.
3. If the list is empty , return 0.
4. If the list is not empty , the length of the last word is given using the function len() and indexing is -1.The command looks like len(words[-1]).
5. The length of the last word of the input string is returned.

Code (Python):
def last_word(sentence):
   word = sentence.split()
   if not word:
        return 0
   return len(word[-1])
a = input()
word_length = last_word(a)
print(word_length)

Result : 
Input :  Assignment is done.
Output : 4
